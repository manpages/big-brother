# I'm frustrated about the current state of deployment of fucking scripts.
# Programs in python and ruby are fucking scripts, those should be deployable
# like G-d damn PHP shit or statically linked binaries. With all the fucking
# libraries included, without conflicts with ridiculous policies of different
# distros of Linux (yes, Arch Linux, I'm talking about you). 
# I'm not saying that this should be the only way to deploy those, I'm saying 
# that it's a sane requirement to be able to share your work with the End User.
# You hacked something over a day or two and you must be able to make a fucking
# release. Look at Erlang. Well, okay, Erlang is an engineering masterpiece,
# but why can't scripting languages learn something about the pros and cons
# of releases?
#
# And script writers should use fucking Makefiles to print their shit where it
# needs to go and to revert it after user is frustrated with the fact that 
# installed scripts are slow as fuck and don't do what they should.
# I wanted to write a software that will be cross platform, that can be 
# extended to work on Шindoшs, that can help all the people to organize the
# time they spend behind the computer desk better... instead I have ended up
# with another program for nerds. Yeah, maybe it's me who sucks, maybe I don't
# push it too hard, don't use ``XMLConfigGeneratorFactorySingleton`` to provide
# the End User the most satisfying experience possible, but I prefer to think 
# that the world where we need XMLConfigGeneratorFactorySingletons to do
# things in a way that doesn't suck needs to be fixed.
#
# I thank G-d for shell script.

# P.S.
# This code is written in two feelings:
#   1. Frustration
#   2. Desperation
# Hence, it sucks big time. If you want to point it out, you should rewrite
# it instead.
